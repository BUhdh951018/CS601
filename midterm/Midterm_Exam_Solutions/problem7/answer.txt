Question 7

Why flexbox:
1. flexbox require less typing than normal table element
2. we change the order of the element without changing the HTML dom by using flexbox, while it's impossible with tables

Why not float:
1. flexbox is easier to understand and write than just using 'float'
2. flexbox is more powerful

Why not absolute position:
1. this lacks flexibility, which means if there is slight changes you have to change a lot of code
2. this way your code would be difficult to understand and reuse
