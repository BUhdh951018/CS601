Tell me why one should use a flexbox design over stand tables.
How does floating elements work with flexbox structures? 
Why not just float your elements with CSS?
Why is using absolute positioning a bad design choice?

1. It's useful than anything else, it can easily control the postion of the elements by vertrical or horizontal.
2. Floating just control the float left or float right, and flexbox control the vertrical position and the order.
3.Floating just can set the elements in some limit area. Flexbox can make the elements more flexible.
4.Absolute:The element is positioned relative to its first positioned (not static) ancestor element. 
It can be define like this. So it's position just follow the ancestor, cannot be relocate.
