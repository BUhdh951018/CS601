What HTML element will play a movie?
How do you program it to start automatically?

1.<video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

I will use video element with source element.

2.<video width="320" height="240" autoplay>
  <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

autoplay will let it start automatically.
